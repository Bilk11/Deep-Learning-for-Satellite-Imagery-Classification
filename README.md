# Deep Learning for Satellite Image Classification (xView Benchmark)

This project explores deep learning approaches for object classification in high-resolution satellite imagery using the **xView recognition benchmark**. The goal is to evaluate the performance of feedforward neural networks (ffNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transfer learning with **ResNet50** on a dataset with 12 classes and significant class imbalance.
